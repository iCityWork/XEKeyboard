=PS2 Keyboard for Atari 65XE/130X

== Introduction

There are many old Atari 8-bit computers out there and they have one thing in common, their keyboards were terrible! Give the 30 years and things get even worse; the tracks on the flexible membranes degrade, some to the point where they can't be repaired and replacement parts are getting harder to find.

One solution to this problem is to attach an old PS2 keyboard instead and that's what this project is about.

While the instructions provided are specific to the Atari 65XE and 130XE, the will likely work with any of the 8-bit Ataris albeit with different chip numbers and connection points.
